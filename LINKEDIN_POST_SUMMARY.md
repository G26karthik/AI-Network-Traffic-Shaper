# AI-Based Network Traffic Classifier - LinkedIn Post Summary

## 🎯 Project Elevator Pitch
Built an intelligent network traffic management system that uses Machine Learning to automatically classify and shape network traffic (VoIP, FTP, HTTP) - achieving 80-90% accuracy without relying on outdated port-based rules.

---

## 💡 The Problem I Solved
Traditional network QoS relies on manual port-based rules, which fail when:
- Modern apps use dynamic/non-standard ports
- Traffic is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS defeats DPI)
- New applications require constant rule updates

**My Solution**: ML-based classification using statistical features (packet size, protocol patterns) instead of payload inspection.

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Challenges

### Challenge 1: Label Leakage
**Problem**: Initial model achieved 98% accuracy (too good to be true!)  
**Root Cause**: Used `dst_port` as a feature (directly correlated with label)  
**Solution**: Removed leaking features, achieved realistic 80-90% accuracy  
**Lesson**: Always validate feature independence from labels

### Challenge 2: Domain Shift
**Problem**: Model trained on synthetic data failed on realistic traffic (20% accuracy)  
**Solution**: Generated realistic traffic patterns matching deployment environment  
**Improvement**: 20% → 80% accuracy  
**Lesson**: Training data distribution must match production data

### Challenge 3: Imbalanced Datasets
**Problem**: Initial captures only contained VoIP traffic  
**Solution**: Created balanced dataset generator (400 samples per class)  
**Result**: Improved model generalization across all traffic types

2. **Flow-level Features**: Add packet rate, inter-arrival time, byte distributions

🚀 From Manual QoS Rules to AI-Powered Traffic Management: My PBL Journey

**The Problem**:
Traditional network management relies on port-based classification (VoIP on port 5060, HTTP on port 80). But what happens when apps use dynamic ports? Or when traffic is encrypted? Network admins waste hours configuring manual rules that break constantly.

**My Solution**:
I built an ML-powered traffic classifier that learns patterns instead of relying on static rules. It analyzes packet size, protocol, and behavioral patterns to classify traffic in <1ms - perfect for real-time QoS.

**The Build** (6 weeks):
Week 1-2: Traffic generation & packet capture (PyShark + Npcap)
Week 3-4: Feature engineering & model training (scikit-learn)
Week 5: Real-time prediction & Windows Firewall integration
Week 6: Testing, documentation, & performance tuning

**Results**:
✅ 90% accuracy on synthetic data
✅ 80% accuracy on realistic traffic
✅ <1ms inference per packet
✅ Automated QoS without manual config

**Key Challenges**:
1. Label Leakage: Initial 98% accuracy was "too good" - I was accidentally using the label in features! Fixed by careful feature selection.
2. Domain Shift: Model trained on synthetic data failed (20% accuracy) on realistic traffic. Solution: Generate training data matching deployment.
3. Real-time Performance: Needed <1ms inference for live traffic. RandomForest delivered; deep learning was overkill.

**Real-World Impact**:
This isn't just academic - ISPs use similar systems for 1M+ subscribers, enterprises prioritize VoIP automatically, and security teams detect data exfiltration.

**What I Learned**:
• Network engineering (packet capture, protocols, QoS)
• Production ML (feature engineering, validation, deployment)
• The hard truth: 80% accuracy from proper methodology > 98% from cheating

Tech Stack: Python | PyShark | scikit-learn | TShark | Npcap

📖 Documented everything in a 50+ page report + testing guide.

Grateful for this hands-on learning experience in Computer Networks!
